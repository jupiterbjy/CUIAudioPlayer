## CUI Audio Player

Just a tiny project to create a script that literally does its name.

Current status:  
![](Demo/Demo.webp)

## Background

Originally meant to create a testing bed for learning *sounddevice* module for use in project
[VirtualTrans](github.com/jupiterbjy/VirtualTrans), turns out to be this was pretty challenging and fun.

Therefore, I've changed *VirtualTrans* repo to *ProjectIncubator*, and separated this using ```subtree split```.

As I find newly discovered [py_cui](https://github.com/jwlodek/py_cui) promising and suits my tastes a lot,
I'm going to finish this project as usable-state unlike my other repos.

Plus, this will be my first repo using git features like milestones, issue, etc -
probably I'll be only one using the latter tho.

## Status

This impressive pre-stone-age program does whopping 4 actions:
- refresh audio list
- show *part* of metadata (No joke!)
- play & stop, no pause
